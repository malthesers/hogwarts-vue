# ![hogwarts crest](https://github.com/malthesers/hogwarts/blob/main/favicon/favicon-32x32.png) Hogwarts

Made as part of KEA's multimedia design, during third semester front-end development course.

Assume the role of a Hogwarts system administrator [right here](https://malthesers.github.io/hogwarts/).

There is a ~5% chance that the student list might not be displayed. If it happens, simply reload.

## 📋 Instructions

### 🏠 House Navigation

Due to poor UX, it may not have been noticeable, but the loading animation crest serves as a way to navigate from house to house.

Click it at the bottom of the screen to open the menu and hit any house to visit that house, changing the logo and colour theme.

To return to the original list, hit the 'H' in the middle of the four houses.

### 🛡️ Admin Powers

Browse the students of Hogwarts with the option to:
- make 2 students of each house prefects, but only 1 of each gender - JKR putting NBs in shambles
- make any student an inquisitor if they are from that one evil house or they are full-blood - JKR loves eugenics I guess
- expel anyone. yep.

### 👀 Searching, filtering and sorting

#### 🔍 Searching

Search through students by their first and last name using the input field next to the magnifying glass looking wand thingy.

It matches by anywhere in the either first or last name.

#### 📛 Filtering

To open the filtering click next to the badge icon to enable filtering by:
- All Students
- Current Studets
- Expelled Students
- Captains
- Prefects
- Inquisitors

#### ↕️ Sorting

Sort by either first name, last name or house in alphabetical order by clicking next to the hat icon.

Reversable by clicking again. Default is first name a-to-z.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Hacking Hogwarts

To hack Hogwarts, input *imperio* in the search field and hit enter.

You might notice some changes:
- regarding blood status,
- when making students inquisitors,
- and a new student? I wonder what might happen if you expel them one too many times...
